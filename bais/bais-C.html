      preamble: 'The following scale is designed to measure auditory imagery, or the way in which you "think about sounds in your head." For the following pairs of items you are asked to do the following: Read the first item (marked "a") and consider whether you think of an image of the described sound in your head. Then read the second item (marked "b") and consider how easily you could change your image of the first sound to that of the second sound and hold this image. Rate how easily you could make this change using the "Ease of Change Rating Scale." If no images are generated, give a rating of 1. Please read "a" first and "b" second for each pair. It may be necessary to cover up "b" so that you focus first on "a" for each pair. Please feel free to use all of the levels in the scale when selecting your ratings.',
