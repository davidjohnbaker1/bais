# bais

Code to run Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale in jsPsych

To run just open ```bais/bais.html``` in your favorite browser.
In order to run separate versions, just open the respective files in ```bais```.

I am trying to figure out how the get the second screen to go to the top after the click and the scores to get calculated on the final screen.

After you download the ```.csv``` file you can use the ```analysis/score_bais.R``` script to make a file that scores the BAIS by taking the average of the responses.

Eventully I plan to add a second scoring column that will multiply scores by the factor loadings.
